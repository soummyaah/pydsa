## Installation

To install PyDSA, simply run:

```python
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

```python
In [1]: from pydsa import quick_sort

In [2]: a = [2, 10, 10, 2, 7, 7, 2, 5, 4, 10]

In [3]: quick_sort(a)
Out[3]: [2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7, 7, 10, 10, 10]
```

```python
In [1]: from pydsa import merge_sort

In [2]: b = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 9, 7, 8, 5]

In [3]: merge_sort(b)
Out[3]: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9]

```

## Development Environment

The source code is managed with the Git version control system. To get the latest development version and access to the full repository, clone the repository from Github with:

```

To run tests:

```
$ py.test
```
